## Pipeline for CHAMPS, done (so far) by Marco Mravic DeGrado lab
## Dependencies: Python 2.7, Biopython, ProDy, NumPy, Rosetta locally downloaded & compiled
# add the CHAMP/bin/ to your python path!! $PYTHONPATH


# Making base CAHMP dir and the working dir for CHAMP target of choice, e.g. a5 dir

# Must also have a 40-residue single 'ideal' alpha helix PDB to thread this sequence on

## Clustering, hierarchical at the level of the average pairwise distance

## Took all of m1 unique designs to simulation & association energy stages
## For m4, took 1-2 highest scoring (packstat) from each cluster
# criteria: top in cluster if >0.5 ps, & next best in cluster is > 0.52 and not too close in seq to original. Wary of TMTrp
## m4 has list at the end of it's '**fasta_summary.txt' file. This was used to make this input path list

### Way later, after experimental results were found, calculate the delta G of association, by subtracting the final score minus the score of two helices alone

### For match 1, look at all n=156 unique sequences
